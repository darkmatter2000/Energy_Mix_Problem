# Quantum optimization algorithms for solving the electricity mix problem in the case of a renewable energy bouquet.

Generating electrical energy from renewable sources has become a crucial challenge in the face of current climate issues. Electricity distribution networks now incorporate numerous renewable energy sources, and the ultimate goal is to achieve fully renewable electricity production, relying on a diverse energy mix that includes photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, and many others. Each means of production comes with associated costs that extend beyond financial aspects and encompass environmental considerations as well. Thus, there are different ways to combine these energy sources. 

With this perspective in mind, we propose a study focusing on the use of quantum computing to find an optimal combination of renewable energies while minimizing costs. However, it is important to emphasize that the work presented in this study is solely a demonstration and does not rely on real data or a concrete model. Its objective is to highlight the potential resolution of this problem through quantum computing. In this regard, we strive to find, using a quantum approach, an energy combination that minimizes costs.
